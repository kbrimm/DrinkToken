# DrinkToken

## About

DrinkToken is an Android app designed to track alcohol intake. I started this project out of a particular need 
that wasn't met in other products currently available. DrinkToken differs from other available implementations 
by offering a simple interface that is quick to use. It makes no claims to predict one's BAC, which is a risky 
and ultimately misleading metric. Instead, it charts reported intake levels and generates useful, comprehensive 
metrics that allow the user to monitor their behavior with historical context.

## Can I Contribute?

Yes! Please do! DrinkToken is still in its early development stages. Missing features are documented in the 
project issues, and sorted into ordered milestones. Development and release versions will follow the published 
milestone order, but anything not currently assigned to a user is up for grabs!

To contribute to this project, follow these steps:

1. Select the issue you'd like to work on, and assign yourself.
2. Clone the repo and push a new branch from dev:
  * Branch naming convention: `<issue#>-<brief-description>`.
  * Ex: `#1-dashboard-scaling-and-orientation-changes`
3. Write your code!
  * Commit early and often.
  * Commit naming convention: `<issue#>-<present-tense-changes>`.
  * Ex: `#1-implements-dashboard-scaling-per-resolution`
4. Submit a pull request to the dev branch:
  * Pull request naming convention: `<issue#>-PR-<branch-description>`.
  * Ex: `#1-PR-dashboard-scaling-and-orientation-changes`

I will evaluate your changes and merge as appropriate, and will give you my undying gratitude.
