# DrinkToken

## About

DrinkToken is an Android app designed to track alcohol intake. I started this project out of a particular need 
that wasn't met in other products currently available. DrinkToken differs from other available implementations 
by offering a simple interface that is quick to use. It makes no claims to predict one's BAC, which is a risky 
and ultimately misleading metric. Instead, it charts reported intake levels and generates useful, comprehensive 
metrics that allow the user to monitor their behavior with historical context.

## Device Support

DrinkToken currently plays nicely with KitKat (Android 4.4) through Marshmallow (Android 6.1). The interface 
is optimized for screen sizes between 4" and 6" tall. The current layout will scale reasonably well to as low 
as 3.7", but much smaller and important things start to fall out of view. On the other end of the scale, things 
start to feel a bit lonely on screens past the 6.5" mark.

## Can I Contribute?

Yes! Please do! DrinkToken is still in its early development stages. Missing features are documented in the 
project issues, and sorted into ordered milestones. Development and release versions will follow the published 
milestone order, but anything not currently assigned to a user is up for grabs!

This project has been developed using Android Studio, so it plays nicely with that environment. One strong 
benefit of this IDE is that it is supported by a wide variety of operating systems. Android Studio can be 
downloaded from [android.com](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html).

To contribute to this project, follow these steps:

1. Select the issue you'd like to work on, and assign yourself.
2. Clone the repo and push a new branch from dev:
  * Branch naming convention: `<issue#>-<brief-description>`.
  * Ex: `#1-dashboard-scaling-and-orientation-changes`
3. Write your code!
  * Commit early and often.
  * Commit naming convention: `<issue#> - <present tense changes>`.
  * Ex: `#1 - Implements dashboard scaling per resolution`
4. Submit a pull request to the dev branch:
  * Pull request naming convention: `<issue#> PR - <branch description>`.
  * Ex: `#1 PR - Dashboard scaling and orientation changes`

Changes are evaluated and merged as appropriate, and are always met with undying gratitude.
